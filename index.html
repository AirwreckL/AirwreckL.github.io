        <h3>The #1 storage solution to storing items</h3>
        <h4 class = "section-title">MOD DESCRIPTION</h4>
        <p>
            Ender Storage is designed to have one block for the user to use, and functions just like a normal chest.
            However, it also allows for items to be searched up and taken out dynamically.
            This dramatically cuts down on the planning needed for item organization, while also allowing
            a balanced solution to the vanilla problem.
        </p>
        <h4 class = "section-title">FEATURES</h4>
        <p>
            Two new blocks: The Storage Heart, and Obsidian Chests<br>
            The Storage Heart works like a regular chest, 
            but also allows searching of the items you currenty have.<br>
            The Obsidian Chests are the actual storage parts of the mod, and
            contain the same amount of storage capacity as a regular chest.
            You cannot actually use these Obsidian Chests without the Storage Heart.

            I'll try to respond to emails as I can, but once I get this mod ready as I want
            I probably won't add too much on, just keep it updated and bug free as possible.
